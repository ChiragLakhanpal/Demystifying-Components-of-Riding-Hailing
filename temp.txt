1. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

|               The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), also known as mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD), is a measure of prediction 
|               accuracy of a forecasting method in statistics. It usually expresses the accuracy as a ratio defined by the formula:

2. **Akaike information criterion (AIC)**

|               The Akaike information criterion is an estimator of prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical models for a 
|               given set of data.Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the  
|               other models.:

3. **R squared (R^2^)**

|               In statistics, the coefficient of determination, denoted R2 or r2 and pronounced "R squared", is the proportion of the variation 
|               in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
