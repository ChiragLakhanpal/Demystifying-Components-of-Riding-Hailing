# Demystifying-Components-of-Riding-Hailing

##### One of the most famous pictures of New York is the wave of yellow taxi taxis flooding the streets. So, where better to research taxi cab data than New York City? This is exactly what we intended to do. From 2009 until the present, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has gathered massive amounts of data for every taxi travel in New York City. We set out to get our hands dirty and put the sophisticated analysis,we learnt over the semester to work.


##### **We wanted to see how parameters like pick-up location, distance, number of passengers, and drop-off location impact the tipping behavior of NYC taxi drivers.**
