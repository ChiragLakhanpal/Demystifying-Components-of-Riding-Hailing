# Movies, Data, and Chaos: Journey of IMDB ratings through COVID

### **About Project:**

In the age of streaming and on-demand content, finding new shows and movies to watch can be overwhelming. In fact, just keeping track of what is available can be a challenge. The competition for our attention is only getting fiercer. Often the primary deciding factor affecting user decisions in selecting a movie is IMDB - one of the most popular databases of information about movies. In this project, we try to analyze various facets of the ratings provided by IMDB and answer questions such as: 

1. What factors affect the ratings of the movies/series (Runtime, Genre, population age, gender, marketing/reach, User rating vs. IMDB rating)
2. How did covid affect the ratings of the movies?
3. Rating vs. Comercial success

### **Dataset Overview:**

The dataset is an amalgamation of attributes like genre, region, language, runtime, title, and more from different datasets linked below. However, it will require significant cleaning, for instance, removing special characters from the title field, excluding redundant data, and omitting data beyond 2000-2022.
